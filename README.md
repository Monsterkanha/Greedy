# Tasks and deadline given start and endtime -> maximum number of activitites. 
-> Here, we will sort by end time. and now its time to take activity only if the start time is grater than end time. 

# duration and deadline given, 
Here, suppose you have queue which has n element and a variable that tells us the minimum distance so far
Now, if the current element fits in then okay other wise we have to remove the one that costs us the maximum.
