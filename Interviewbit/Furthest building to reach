See whether i can reach to this building, top maximum distance i will use stairs. of r, 
and later all with bricks

class Solution {
public:
    int furthestBuilding(vector<int>& heights, int bricks, int ladders) {
        int n = heights.size();
        priority_queue<int> pq;
        int i, rem = 0;
        for(i = 0; i < n-1; i++){
            if(heights[i] < heights[i+1]){
                pq.push(-(heights[i+1] - heights[i]));
                if(pq.size() > ladders){        means remaining we need to have with bricks if we have enough bricks then okay. otherwise we cannot go beyond this point.
                    rem += (-pq.top());
                    pq.pop();
                }
                if(rem > bricks)    break;
            }
        }
        return i;
    }
};
