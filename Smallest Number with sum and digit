Intuition :-
Greedily fill from right to left. 
first decrement 1 from S to make sure easy process.

Now if(S > 9 ) then add 9 to that position and decrement S by 9;
else put S there and make S = 0;
Now loop continue till index 1;
Now, incorporate that 1. add 1 with S and put to index zero.

if(S == 0){
  if(D == 1){
      return "0";
  }
  else{
      return "-1";
  }
}
if( S > 9*D){
  return "-1";
}


string s = "";
S--;  // To make sure we will have better atleast 1 at left most
// since, 0 can't be put to left most. to make sure valid we are finding for index 1 to n and calculate for index 0;


for(int i = D-1; i>0 ; i--){                // Run loop till index 1 only.
  if(S > 9){
      s = '9' + s;    // If sum is greater greedily put 9 and decrement 
      S -= 9;
  }
  else{
      s = to_string(S) + s;   // Now, put whatever remaining and make it to zero.
      S = 0;
}
}
s = (to_string(1 + S)) + s;
// 1 is added because we have initially subtracted. 
return s;
